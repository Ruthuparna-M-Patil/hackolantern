# Hack O' Lantern
Repository for Hack O' Lantern - the Hacktoberfest event by DSC REVA University to learn how to create your own portfolio website and host it on GitHub. 



# Tasks for students

1. Replace the image, bio, projects, experiences on the website with your own details. (The image and details can be different or your own portfolio)
2. Make a table which contains the different languages you can speak, read and write in. 
3. Use some of the CSS properties that you've learnt like bgcolor, padding, margin to style and align the html elements.
4. Convert your projects into links such that clicking them would redirect to your project repository.


* The website reference code is index.html and style.css. 

# How to complete the tasks

* Clone the forked repository on your device
* In the cloned repository, open the tasks folder and create a new folder inside it with your own Name (Eg. John_Doe)
